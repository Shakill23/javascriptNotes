// ============ While loop  ============
// This loop will keep repeating while the condition is true, with the condition being checked before each iteration.. 

// ============ Example 1  ============

    console.log("The number is " + i);

// ============ Do While Loop ============
// This loop will keep repeating while the condition is true, with the condition only being checked after each iteration.

// This loop will keep repeating for a predetermined number of times.
