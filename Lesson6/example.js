// This is a comment in JavaScript. 
// Comments can be placed anywhere in JavaScript code and the computer ignores them -- they are intended to be read by humans. 
// Any line with a // in front of it is a comment.
/* If you want to add a long comment that spans across several lines,
then you would use a multi-line comment. As you can see, a multi-line
comment starts with a /* and ends with */

// ================== Types of Errors ==================
// There are 3 types of errors:
//   - Compilation or syntax errors
//   - Runtime errors
//   - Logical errors


// ************ Example 1 ************ 
// Console.log("Hello World!");
// The statement above is an example of a syntax error.
// As you can see the print keyword has a capital 'C', but JavaScript is case sensitive so Console and console are two different things.
// Try removing the // from in front of the console.log statement and run this program; do you see the error?

// ************ Example 2 ************
// let word = "JavaScript";
// let character = word[10];
// The statement above is an example of a runtime error.
// As you can see, the second statement is referencing an index that is out of bounds.
// Try removing the // from in front of both statements above and run this program; do you see the error?

// ************ Example 3 ************
// let areaTrapezoid = 3 + 5 * 6 / 2
// console.log(areaTrapezoid);
// The statement above is an example of a logical error.
// The code above should calculate the area of a Trapezoid with parallel sides of length 3 and 5, and a height of 6.
// The area of this trapezoid should be 24, but when you run this program, you see that this is not the case.
// This is because of the missing brackets around 3 + 5
// The statement should be:
//       areaTrapezoid = (3 + 5) * 6 / 2
